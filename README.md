![Project Banner](https://img.shields.io/badge/Explainable%20AI-Physics%20Inspired-blue)
**Version:** 10.0 | **Features:** GIF Animations, Contradiction Detection, Multi-Model Support

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Overview**
**LLM Insight** is a **physics-inspired framework** for **visual debugging of Large Language Models (LLMs)**. It treats **tokens as particles influenced by semantic and attention forces**, enabling **real-time visualization of reasoning patterns, contradictions, and hallucinations**.

This project was developed as part of **Microsoft Student Ambassador Project Demo Day** by **Team XAI-Phy** (Shakthi Lakmal & Poorna Madhushan).

## **ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement**
- LLMs are **powerful but opaque** â€“ they often act as **black boxes**.
- Users struggle to understand:
  - Why a model gives a certain answer.
  - Where contradictions or hallucinations appear.
- Lack of **visual debugging tools** â†’ makes trust & adoption difficult.

## **âœ… Our Solution**
- **Physics-Inspired Simulation** for LLM reasoning.
- **Tokens as Particles** influenced by:
  - **Semantic Forces** (cosine similarity).
  - **Attention Forces** (attention weights).
- **Visualizations**:
  - Token clustering.
  - Contradiction detection.
  - Hallucination mapping.
- **Supports Multiple Models**: GPT-2, BERT, DistilBERT, Sentence Transformers.
